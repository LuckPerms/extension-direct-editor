# extension-direct-editor

An extension for LuckPerms v5, which hosts a customized bytebin directly within the Minecraft server, which in turn allows the editor to directly talk with the
server in order to allow editing the permissions directly.

Currently this is very WIP and not ready to be used. Once it is ready the LuckPermsWeb install script will have a mode to work with this extension.

### Usage

Just install the extension as you would any other and setup LuckPermsWeb to use the webserver as the bytebin instance.
